The point is that directly storing your data in the array is often memory prohibitive, so instead for example you might store the filenames of images in your ItemList object mydata and then retrieve the tensor of pixel data only when mydata.get is called.

The point of an autoencoder isn't just to copy the image data to a different format, it's to efficiently encode the essence of the data. Therefore, we're going to add a layer that cuts down the storage space the encoded image occupies and see how well it can reconstruct the original."
